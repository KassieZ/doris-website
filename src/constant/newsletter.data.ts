        content: `Apache Doris is a real-time data warehouse commonly used for observability, cyber security analysis, online reports, customer profiles, data lakehouse and more. Elasticsearch is more like a search engine, but it is also widely used for data analytics, so there's an overlap in their use cases. The comparison in this post will focus on the real-time analytics capabilities of Apache Doris and Elasticsearch from a user-oriented perspective`,
